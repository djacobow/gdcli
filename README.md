Yet Another Google Drive CLI client

## What

I just want to be able to do simple operations with Google Drive from
the command line. There are other tools for this, but this one is mine.

## Testing

Almost none so far, but it works for my purposes as the moment.

## TBD

I have coded some Google Team Drive support, but have not tested it yet,
and do not expect it to work without some tweaks.
